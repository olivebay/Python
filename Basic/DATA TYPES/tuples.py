'''Tuples are used to store multiple items in a single variable.

Tuple is one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data, the other 3 are List, Set, and Dictionary, all with different qualities and usage.

A tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable.

Tuples are written with round brackets.'''

tuplev = ("a", "b", "c")
print(tuplev)

#will give you : ('a', 'b', 'c')

tuples = ("a", "b", 2)
print(tuplev)

#will give you : tuples = ("a", "b", 2)

#seems similar to a list doesn't it ?

#we are gonna disscuss how it is different later on...
