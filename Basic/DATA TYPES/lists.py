'''Lists are used to store multiple items in a single variable.

Lists are one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data, the other 3 are Tuple, Set, and Dictionary, all with different qualities and usage.'''

#examples -

listy = ["a", "b", "c"]
print(listy)

#the output will be : ['a', 'b', 'c']


listx = [1, 2, 3]
print(listx)

#will give : [1, 2, 3]


listz = [True,False]
print(listz)

#will give : [True, False]



#we can also store multiple data types like :

listm = [1,"fal"]
print(listm)

#will give : [1, 'fal']

#we will discuss more things about lists afterwards
