#Python has many core data types such as : Numbers, Sets, None, Sequences, Mappings.

"""Numbers can be further divided into Integers, Floats, Complex and booleans."""

A = 1  #here A is an integers
#we can verify it using the type() function - 
B = type(a) #using the type function 
print B #printing the value of B
#The above will get output as : <class 'int'>
